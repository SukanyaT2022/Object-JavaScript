                The Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is a fountain in 
                the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian architect 
                Nicola Salvi and completed by Pietro Bracci. Standing 26.3 
                metres (86 ft) high and 49.15 metres (161.3 ft) wide,[1] it is 
                the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most 
                famous fountains in the world. The fountain has appeared in 
                several notable films, including Federico Fellini's La Dolce 
                Vita.

                The fountain at the junction of three roads (tre vie)[2] marks 
                the terminal point[3] of the "modern" Acqua Vergine, the revived 
                Aqua Virgo, one of the aqueducts that supplied water to ancient 
                Rome. In 19 BC, supposedly with the help of a virgin, Roman 
                technicians located a source of pure water some 13 km (8.1 mi) 
                from the city. (This scene is presented on the present 
                fountain's façade.) However, the eventual indirect route of the 
                aqueduct made its length some 22 km (14 mi). This Aqua Virgo led 
                the water into the Baths of Agrippa. It served Rome for more 
                than 400 years.[4]

                Legend holds that in 19 BC thirsty Roman soldiers were guided 
                by a young girl to a source of pure water thirteen kilometers 
                from the city of Rome. The discovery of the source led Augustus 
                to commission the construction of a twenty-two kilometer 
                aqueduct leading into the city, which was named Aqua Virgo, or 
                Virgin Waters, in honor of the legendary young girl. The 
                aqueduct served the hot Baths of Agrippa, and Rome, for over 
                four hundred years.

        <h3>Piazza Navona</h3>

            Piazza Navona (pronounced [ˈpjattsa naˈvoːna]) is a piazza in Rome, 
            Italy. It is built on the site of the Stadium of Domitian, built in 
            1st century AD, and follows the form of the open space of the 
            stadium.[1] The ancient Romans went there to watch the agones 
            ("games"), and hence it was known as "Circus Agonalis" 
            ("competition arena"). It is believed that over time the name 
            changed to in avone to navone and eventually to navona.

            Defined as a public space in the last years of 15th century, when 
            the city market was transferred there from the Campidoglio, the 
            Piazza Navona was transformed into a highly significant example of 
            Baroque Roman architecture and art during the pontificate of 
            Innocent X, who reigned from 1644 until 1655, and whose family 
            palace, the Palazzo Pamphili, faced the piazza. It features 
            important sculptural and architectural creations: in the center 
            stands the famous Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi or Fountain of the Four 
            Rivers (1651) by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, topped by the Obelisk of 
            Domitian, brought in pieces from the Circus of Maxentius;[2] the 
            church of Sant'Agnese in Agone by Francesco Borromini, Girolamo 
            Rainaldi, Carlo Rainaldi and others; and the aforementioned Pamphili 
            palace, also by Girolamo Rainaldi, that accommodates the long 
            gallery designed by Borromini and frescoed by Pietro da Cortona.[3]
        </p>
        <p>
            Piazza Navona has two other fountains. At the southern end is the 
            Fontana del Moro with a basin and four Tritons sculpted by Giacomo 
            della Porta (1575) to which, in 1673, Bernini added a statue of a 
            Moor, or African, wrestling with a dolphin. At the northern end is 
            the Fountain of Neptune (1574) also created by Giacomo della Porta; 
            the statue of Neptune, by Antonio Della Bitta, was added in 1878 to 
            create a balance with La Fontana del Moro.

        <h3>The Colosseum</h3>

            The Colosseum or Coliseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre 
            (/kɒləˈsiːəm/ kol-ə-see-əm; Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: 
            Anfiteatro Flavio [anfiteˈatro ˈflavjo] [äɱːfit̪eˈäːt̪ro ˈfläːvjo] or 
            Colosseo [kolosˈsɛo] [koloˈs̪ːɛːo]), is an elliptical amphitheatre 
            in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of concrete and 
            stone,[1] it is the largest amphitheatre ever built and is 
            considered one of the greatest works of architecture and 
            engineering.[2]
        </p>
        <p>
            The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction 
            began under the emperor Vespasian in 72 AD,[3] and was completed in 
            80 AD under his successor and heir Titus.[4] Further modifications 
            were made during the reign of Domitian (81–96).[5] These three 
            emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre 
            was named in Latin for its association with their family name 
            (Flavius).
        </p>
        <p>
            The Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 
            spectators,[6][7] and was used for gladiatorial contests and public 
            spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, 
            re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical 
            mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the 
            early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as 
            housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a 
            quarry, and a Christian shrine.
